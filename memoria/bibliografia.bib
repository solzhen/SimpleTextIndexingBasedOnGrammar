abstract = {A cost function is developed, based on information-theoretic concepts, that measures the complexity of a stochastic context-free grammar, as well as the discrepancy between its language and a given stochastic language sample. This function is used to guide a search procedure that finds simple grammars whose languages are good fits to a sample. Reasonable results have been obtained in a variety of cases, including parenthesis and addition strings, Basic English (the first 25 sentences in English Through Pictures) and chain-encoded chromosome boundaries.}
